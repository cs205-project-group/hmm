Log on to Odyssey with cs205uXX account
    ssh cs205uXX@login.rc.fas.harvard.edu

Before you're starting, make sure you don't have something like

    source new-modules.sh

inside your ~/.bashrc. If you do just comment it out (you can add it back later
when we're done installing).

Set up your own python environment (source:
https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/resources/documentation/software-on-odyssey/python/)

    source new-modules.sh
    module load python/2.7.6-fasrc01
    conda create -n graphlab --clone="$PYTHON_HOME"

wait a while... this will create a new environment in ~/envs/graphlab

Then you can load the environment by using:

    source activate graphlab

To deactivate:

    source deactivate

Activate the new environment, and then install graphlab dependencies and
graphlab itself:

    conda install boto
    conda install tornado
    conda install requests
    conda install colorama
    conda install pyasn1
    conda install dateutil

    pip install graphlab-create



How to install Graphlab Create SDK:

Let's get back to our home directory and clone:

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/dato-code/GraphLab-Create-SDK graphlab-sdk

Build examples:

    module load centos6/gcc-4.8.0
    cd graphlab-sdk && make


Code to compile the example stuff:
    module load centos6/gcc-4.8.0
    g++ -std=c++11 example2.cpp -I ../graphlab-sdk -shared -fPIC -o example2.so

If you can't load the gcc-4.8.0 module, you might still have the new modules
enabled. In that case, run

    module load legacy

And then you should be able to load gcc-4.8.0
