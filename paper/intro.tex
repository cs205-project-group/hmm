\section{Introduction}

Hidden Markov models (HMM) are often used to model time-series data for both
discrete and continuous data. In this paper, we will focus on discrete data. The
parameters to a hidden Markov models are most commonly learned from the
Baum-Welch---an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Unfortunately, the
Baum-Welch algorithm is quadratic in number of states. A parallel implementation
of the EM algorithm along the state axis would greatly improve scalability.
Graph based platforms are particularly suited to EM algorithms, and our project
uses GraphLab~\cite{graphlab}, a platform created by Dato~\cite{dato} for implementing graph based parallelizing schemes.
