\subsection{Hidden Markov Model}
A hidden Markov model assumes that the system follows a Markov process. For this paper, we will assume a finite number of states and observations. The probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ only depends on the current state, and we define transition matrix $A$ such that element $A_{ij}$ is the probability  of transitioning from $i$ to $j$. In an HMM, we cannot observe states, but we can observe outputs generated by the states. Given $N$ states and $M$ observations, we capture this with a $N \times M$ emission matrix $B$, where $B_{ij}$ is the probability of observation $j$ given the state is $i$. Finally,
