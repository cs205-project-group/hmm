\section{Conclusion}

Our implementation demonstrates how HMMs can be implemented using a
graph-parallel approach. Even though our graph-parallel approach is slower than
our serial approach, we show that it achieves better scaling than the serial
approach. Much of the difference in runtime can be attributed to the cost of
creating the Sgraph data structure in GraphLab, and the immutability of Sgraph,
necessitating creation of a new Sgraph data structure for each application of
\texttt{triple\_apply}.
